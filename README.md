# Magic Garden project
#Lab 3 Delivery : We have two players and the idea is that they create a garden. In this delivery we have set assets for the floor and the tools for planting such as the packet of seeds (orange boxes), the watercan and the shovel.At the moment, it is possible to pick the objects when getting close and dropping them by pressing 'R'.
